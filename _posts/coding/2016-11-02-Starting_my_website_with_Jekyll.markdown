I spent most of today setting up my personal website! My brother recommended using Jekyll so I started by looking into what Jekyll was and how I could start using it. I ran into a little trouble at the outset trying to install rubygems (a prerequisite to jekyll). There was a conflict regarding permissions of ruby which came installed on the Mac. I played around with rbenv but eventually found a way to install rubygems and consequently jekyll smoothly.

After that, I still did not have much of an idea of what I was doing. As always, reading through various sections of the documentation (a few times) was quite helpful. It was pretty neat to see the set up of the basic website after I had figured it out; jekyll is pretty neat! Liquid too, which reminds me of jinjja. 

Through the same process of playing around, trying different things and reading documentation, I added a few additional categories in the navbar of my website. This was pretty straightforward, then my next task was to set up the post formats in each of the categories. I decided I wanted my thoughts category to simply have text and not links to posts, as the writing would all be pretty short. 

This led me to reading up a bit on collections in jekyll. Of course in (my experience with) coding, things do not work the first time, and this was no exception. I had a silly mistake that led to my html tags being escaped in each addition to the collection. Once I figured this out I slightly edited the format of that category.

I wanted the other sections: coding, faith, life and sports, to be set up with certain posts on that page, while I wanted <em>all</em> posts to be in the main page regardless of category. The learning process was the same, and it was fun! The main problem was figuring out how to organize my posts within my directories, and then accessing them in each category. For example, at one point I had each test in the right category, however it would make a whole distinct category for that post. Once I got this resolved, I cleaned up the presentation just a bit, and now I have the basic framework of my website set up :D

I am looking forward to doing more with this website, and hopefully I will write at least one post each week!
